      <h3>What is a tracker?</h3>
      <p>
        Third party trackers are designed to amass small bits of information gathered from your personal technology. They combine these pieces until they form an all-too-accurate portrait of your online actvity. Each section is an aspect of your device configuration, which was extracted from your browser. Digital fingerprinting is the process whereby a remote site or service gathers little bits of information about a user's machine, and stitches those pieces together to form a unique picture, or "fingerprint," of the user's device. Once the fingerprint is established, the user is recognizable to any third party with access to their profileâ€“in other words, the user is like a microchipped bird.
