<h5>What is this?</h5>
<p>A web header that is used to let the server know:
<ul>
  <li>if you prefer not to be tracked. This is usually either not delivered at all, or set to ‘1’. A setting of “1” indicates that your browser would prefer not to be tracked, but right now, most sites ignore this request.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h5>How is this used in your fingerprint?</h5>
<p>Browsers which set the DNT header to ‘1’ are fairly rare, and this can be an identifying metric.  However, this should be left as the default for your browser.
