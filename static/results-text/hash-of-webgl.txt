<h5>What is this?</h5>
<p>The 'hash of WebGL fingerprint' is very similar to the 'hash of canvas fingerprint' in its method of using your browser to generate graphics, extracting data from how each pixel is rendered, serializing the result and hashing it. However, it uses WebGL instead. WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics.

<h5>How is this used in your fingerprint?</h5>
<p>The WebGL and Canvas fingerprinting results are highly linked, as they both examine browser-rendered graphics for tiny differences between users.
